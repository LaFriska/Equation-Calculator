<b>Java Calculator</b>

This is a small project I have programmed over a couple of days: a simple calculator
capable of processing mathematical equations with operators
"+", "-", "/", "*" and "^". Brackets are also compatible with this
calculator. I might also implement a GUI using JavaFX in the future.
